You can read the info tab below the software list for How-to.

:::

:::details Why is my torrent not downloading?
There are a few possible causes: the torrent currently has 0 seeders, it has 1 seeder with a bad/limited connection, or you have bad peering (which could be fixed by using a seedbox or VPN). In the case of 0 or bad seeders, you will have to wait for a new seeder to join, or check if a debrid service has the torrent cached.

:::

:::details What is seedbox & debrid service?
### Seedbox
A seedbox is a remote service that can download (leech) & upload (seed) from p2p networks. Since it's always online, it keeps the torrents alive, thus helping you keep a high ratio in [PTs](#pt-private-tracker). Examples: [Ultra.cc](https://ultra.cc/), [RapidSeedbox](https://www.rapidseedbox.com/) & [Pulsed Media](https://pulsedmedia.com/).

### Debrid
Like a seedbox, it's also a remote service. It can download from p2p and various host sites (e.g. [MEGA](https://mega.io/), [RapidGator](https://rapidgators.net/)). One of the big differences is that they (generally) don't seed p2p files and keep the downloaded files cached on their servers, meaning you can download currently dead torrents that have already been cached in the past. Examples: [Real-Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/) & [AllDebrid](https://alldebrid.com/).

:::details What does a VPN do?
Watch [**Tom Scott's video**](https://youtu.be/WVDQEoe6ZWY) for an honest explanation.

:::

:::details Do I need VPN while torrenting?

The distribution (here seeding / uploading) of pirated content is illegal. In peer-to-peer (P2P) connections such as torrenting, it exposes your IP to everyone connected. So, it's advisable to use a VPN which will mask your IP. But if your country / ISP doesn't care about pirating stuff, you can skip VPN. To know whether your country / ISP cares about it, ask in your local forum.

:::

:::details What VPN should I use? Free or Paid?

It has various variables. The free VPNs are very limited such as untrusted owner, data cap, very few servers or very slow speed. Also, it's not like, all the paid VPNs are great. The ownership of the VPN company, the transparency or how they handle government bodies matter a lot.

::: danger Never use Cracked / Modded VPN {open}
You should never use cracked or modded VPN cause all of your traffic will go through that VPN. So using a compromised VPN is extremely risky.
:::

:::details What are private trackers?
Torrent trackers that don't allow you to freely make an account, but require you to get an invitation from an existing member or pass an interview. Some PTs also have specific periods where they allow for open signups. It is important to note that you shouldn't use a VPN when signing up for a private tracker, as the site has to make sure you are a new unique member. Once joined, you should carefully read the rules and see what kind of VPN usage they allow on their site. On the other hand, using VPNs for torrenting is most often allowed, and encouraged.
